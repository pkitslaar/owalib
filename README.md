**owalib** is a pure Python library to access (and fetch) e-mail from MS Exchange 2000/2003 servers 
through Outlook Web Access (OWA) using the WebDAV protocol.

The owalib project files also contain the owafetch utility which is intended to be a drop-in replacement 
for the Java based fetchExc program. This utility allows to fetch e-mail from a MS Exchange Server 
(through Outlook Web Access) and forward it to another address. 

See the OwaFetchQuickStart documentation to quickly setup fetching and forwarding of your 
Outlook Web Access mail to another mail address.
